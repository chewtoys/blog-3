Since Apple introduced the first [push notification service](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/apns?utm_campaign=notification-services) in 2009, push notifications have moved from simple plain texts to rich notifications with buttons, images, and other interactive elements. 

Alongside these advancements in appearance and functionality, various push notification services have emerged, each offering unique features and capabilities.

However, as more push notification services are introduced, it can be challenging to determine which of the [options best suits the product's needs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1d1kv25/what_are_your_thoughts_on_using_push_notification/) and [how to implement them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50850054/create-my-own-push-notification-service-without-fcm-pusher).

This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of push notification services, covering their key components, implementation strategies, and best practices.

## What is a notification service?

A [notification service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_service) is a platform or system that allows you to send messages or alerts, known as **notifications**, to users on various operating systems and devices, including smartphones, tablets, and web browsers. 

These notifications can be triggered by relevant events, updates, or actions and are delivered directly to the user's device, even when the user is not actively using the app or website. 

Here’s a closer look at some types of notifications.

![Types of notifications](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_EC6CD3BD2FEC5CFE2BA0082E00991992FF0203F444E10C9FCDC70007A2F8D1A4_1726564434924_Notification-Types.png)

Different platforms, such as iOS, Android, and web browsers, have their specific notification services. 

For example, [Apple Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering-your-app-with-apns) (APNs) and [Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) (FCM) are widely used for mobile notifications. 

In contrast, web browsers might use services like [Web Push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) to deliver notifications to desktop or mobile browsers.

### Why notification services are essential for today's applications

Notification services help maintain user engagement and drive repeat visits to apps and websites by delivering timely updates, reminders, and promotions. 

For instance, a well-timed notification about an upcoming sale or an expiring coupon can prompt users to return and take immediate action, increasing conversions and customer retention.

Another advantage of notification services is their [cross-platform](https://novu.co/usecases/multi-channel-notifications/?utm_campaign=notification-services) nature. 

Businesses can seamlessly connect with users across devices, whether through push notifications, text messages, or emails, ensuring the message reaches the user wherever they are, maximizing the chances of interaction.

## Notification service vs. push notification services

A notification service can send messages through many channels - [email](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/email/overview), [Chat](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/chat/overview), [In-App inbox (Notification center feed)](https://docs.novu.co/additional-resources/glossary#in-app-notification), and [texts (SMS)](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/sms/overview). 

[Push notification services](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/overview?utm_campaign=notification-services) are more specific in what they do - they only send alerts directly to phones and web browsers.

You can think of push notification services as one piece of the larger notification service family, like how text messaging is just one way to communicate.

These services let applications send push notifications (messages) straight to users' devices, mainly through mobile apps and web browsers.

Here is an illustration of the notification lifecycle, which shows how notifications are created, sent, received, and completed.

![Notification lifecycle](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_EC6CD3BD2FEC5CFE2BA0082E00991992FF0203F444E10C9FCDC70007A2F8D1A4_1726752794050_Notification-Lifecycle.png)

### Mobile push notification services

[Mobile push notification services](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/overview?utm_campaign=notification-services) allow you to send real-time notifications directly to users on mobile devices. These services are crucial if you want to stay connected with your users, allowing you to send alerts, updates, reminders, or promotions—even when they’re not actively using your app.

### Web push notification services

[Web push notification services](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/push-webhook?utm_campaign=notification-services) send notifications to users through web browsers. They reach users on desktop and mobile devices, even if they don’t have a mobile app installed. These services work across browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, ensuring broad platform compatibility.

## Benefits of using push notifications services

Push notification services can improve cross-platform reach, enhance personalization, and provide valuable analytics insights.

1. **Cross-platform reach:** Whether through mobile apps or web browsers, push notification services ensure you can reach audiences on any device.
2. **Enhanced personalization:** Push notification services allow for personalized messaging based on user data, ensuring the content is relevant and tailored to individual preferences. If done right, they can increase customer retention.
3. **Analytics provision**: Push notification services allow monitoring click and open rates, providing analysts with valuable insights to optimize the timing, delivery, and effectiveness of notifications.

Now let’s consider the critical components of push notification services.

## Key components of push notification services

Push notification services rely on several essential components to deliver messages effectively across various devices. These include:

### Notification servers

Notification servers manage and route messages from the first point (application) to the end (user’s device). These servers receive incoming notification requests from apps or web services, process them, and deliver them to the appropriate platforms (such as iOS, Android, or web browsers). Some key functions of the notification server are:

* Managing the message queue for efficient delivery
* Automatically retrying delivery when a notification fails

Some popular notification servers include [FCM](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/overview?utm_campaign=notification-services) and [APNs](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/apns?utm_campaign=notification-services).

### Software Development Kits (SDKs)

SDKs integrate push notification functionality within applications. They communicate with notification servers, register the user's device, manage permissions, and display notifications on the client side.

An example is [Novu](https://docs.novu.co/getting-started/introduction?utm_campaign=notification-services), which has both [client-side](https://docs.novu.co/sdks/framework/typescript/overview) and [server-side](https://docs.novu.co/sdks/java) SDKs and supports different [notification server providers](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/overview?utm_campaign=notification-services) for both mobile and [web push notifications](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/push-webhook?utm_campaign=notification-services) for seamless integration in any application stack.

### Messaging protocols

Messaging protocols define the rules and standards that govern how notifications are sent and received between the notification servers and client devices. 

These protocols ensure that messages are delivered securely and efficiently. 

Common messaging protocols include HTTP/2, which is used by [APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-notification-requests-to-apns#Establish-a-connection-to-APNs), and [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) or [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), which can be used by [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options).

Together, these key components form the foundation of push notification providers.

## Integrating push notification providers

### Managing Device Tokens

Device tokens are unique identifiers for devices that receive notifications. They are used to send notifications to specific devices.

* **Just-in-time:** Pass tokens in the workflow trigger payload:

```js
novu.trigger("workflow-id", {
    to: {
        subscriberId: "subscriber-id",
        channels: [{
            providerId: "fcm",
            credentials: {
                deviceTokens: ["token-1", "token-2"],
            },
        }, ],
    },
    payload: {},
});
```

* **Pre-fetching tokens:** Store tokens in a database or local storage and pass them in the trigger payload:

```js
const tokens = await fetchTokensFromDatabase();

novu.trigger("workflow-id", {
    to: {
        subscriberId: "subscriber-id",
        channels: [{
            providerId: "fcm",
            credentials: {
                deviceTokens: tokens,
            },
        }, ],
    },
```

* **Manual token management:** If you prefer, update subscriber data using the [Set Credentials API](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/update-subscriber-credentials).

### Create a notification workflow

In Novu, creating a workflow means establishing a blueprint for sending notifications within your app. This unified structure ties together email, in-app messages, SMS, push notifications, and chat into one entity.

> **Note:** Each workflow includes:
> - A unique name and identifier
> - Customized content for various channels using {{handlebars}} variables for personalization

#### Using the UI (Novu Dashboard)

Using the UI, you can create a workflow by following these steps:

1. Navigate to 'Workflows' tab and click on 'Blank Workflow'
2. Drag and drop the Push channel node to the workflow

#### Templates and personalization:

Create [reusable templates](https://docs.novu.co/community/add-a-new-provider#template-test-case-for-example-provider/?utm_campaign=notification-services) for your notifications on the notification service. You can do this by adding:

* **Dynamic content:** Include placeholders in your templates for user-specific details, like names or recent activity.
* **Event-driven notifications:** Tailor notifications based on user behavior or specific events, such as abandoned carts or account updates.

    ![A reminder notification about an event viewed on Meetup](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_EC6CD3BD2FEC5CFE2BA0082E00991992FF0203F444E10C9FCDC70007A2F8D1A4_1725360850667_Screenshot_20240903-012319.png)

* **Multi-language content management:** For applications with a global user base, localize notifications and deliver them in the user’s language.

Now that the notification provider is implemented and configured, let’s explore some best practices for using and choosing push notification services.

## Best practices for push notification provider services

Implementing push notification provider services requires adherence to several best practices so your notifications achieve maximum impact. 

Here are some practices to keep in mind:

### Reliability and uptime

Set up alerts for downtime or delivery issues, and regularly monitor your notification service’s performance. 

Consider using one of the top push notification services, like [Novu](https://novu.co/pricing/?utm_campaign=notification-services)[, ](https://novu.co/pricing/?utm_campaign=notification-services) [](https://novu.co/pricing/)which offers 99.99% **Service Level Agreements** (SLAs), guaranteeing good uptime.

### Handling high volumes of notifications

Efficient management of high notification volumes is crucial, especially during peak times or large campaigns. 

To prepare for forecasted peak periods, such as festivities and Black Fridays, test the push notification service under load conditions similar to these high-traffic times. 

This helps identify and address potential bottlenecks that could affect users.

### Personalization and targeting

Personalized and targeted notifications are more likely to engage users and drive action. Implement A/B testing to determine which types of notifications resonate best with different segments of your target audience and continuously refine this targeting strategy based on the results to improve engagement rates.

### Security considerations

Security is a fundamental aspect of push notification services, especially when handling sensitive user data like finance notifications. Protecting this data requires careful attention to regulatory compliance and secure data transmission practices.

* **Data privacy regulations:** To handle user data responsibly, adhere to data privacy regulations like the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR) and the [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) (CCPA). Obtain explicit user consent before sending notifications and be transparent about how their data is used.

* **Secure transmission**: All data transmitted through the push notification service should be encrypted using protocols like [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)[(TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to prevent unauthorized access and protect user information.

By following these best practices, businesses and developers can continue building trust with users while maximizing the effectiveness of push notifications as a communication channel.

## Challenges and solutions in push notification provider services

Here are some common challenges and how to address them:

### Dealing with notification fatigue

* **Challenge:** Notification fatigue occurs when users are overwhelmed by the volume or frequency of notifications they receive. This can lead to disabling notifications or [uninstalling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/zc9mv/dear_app_developers_if_your_app_spams_up_my/) the app altogether, reducing engagement and the effectiveness of communication efforts.

* **Solution:** Limit frequency and provide users with control over their [notification preferences](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/preferences#preferences/?utm_campaign=notification-services). For example, a social media app should provide granular controls for users to choose which types of activities trigger notifications.

    ![Snapchat’s notification control](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_EC6CD3BD2FEC5CFE2BA0082E00991992FF0203F444E10C9FCDC70007A2F8D1A4_1726564460021_Screenshot.png)

### Global reach

* **Challenge:** For apps with a diverse, worldwide user base, delivering notifications reliably across different network conditions, devices, and time zones can be challenging.

* **Solution:** Use various [notification channels](https://novu.co/usecases/multi-channel-notifications/?utm_campaign=notification-services) to deliver and adapt notifications to different languages and cultural contexts. You can use a service that combines push notifications with SMS fallback to reach users in areas with poor internet connectivity.

### Monitoring and analytics

* **Challenge:** Without proper monitoring and analytics, it can be difficult to gauge the effectiveness of your push notification strategy. You may struggle to understand which notifications drive engagement and which are ignored, making it hard to optimize your campaigns.

* **Solutions:** Implement dashboards to monitor key metrics and gain insights into notification performance. Also, conduct experiments to optimize notification content and timing. You can achieve this by testing two different notification copy styles to see which one drives higher course completion rates.
    

### Scaling notifications infrastructure

* **Challenge:** As your user base grows, your notification infrastructure needs to scale efficiently to handle the increasing volume of notifications. Without proper scaling, you might face delivery failures or system outages during peak times.

* **Solutions:** Implement robust queuing systems to handle traffic spikes and group notifications for more efficient sending. For example, you might experience a surge in user activity during a product launch with millions of users awaiting updates. Using a cloud-based notification service like Novu with [auto-scaling](https://docs.novu.co/deployment/production?utm_campaign=notification-services), all users can receive timely notifications about the launch without disruption.

Let's look at some real-life examples of businesses successfully using push notification services to address challenges and improve their operations.

## Case studies and examples
