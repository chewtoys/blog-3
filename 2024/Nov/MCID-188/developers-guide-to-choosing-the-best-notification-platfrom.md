## What are notifications?

Notifications are messages or alerts designed to inform or remind users about specific events or important updates related to an application or service. Different types of notifications are used in digital products, each serving distinct purposes. Some of the main types of notifications include web push notifications, in-app, email, and SMS notifications. Each of these will be explored in detail below:

### Push notification

[Push notifications](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/providers/push/overview?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) are short, clickable messages sent directly to users’ devices from an application, even when they are not actively using it. They are typically popular, with Business of Apps reporting an [overall opt-in rate of 60%](https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/push-notifications/research/push-notifications-statistics/). Some use cases of push notifications include usage by online retailers and E-commerce apps to alert loyal customers about sales and promotions or on social media platforms to notify users of new messages, likes, or comments.

### In-app notifications

In-app notifications appear within the application while users are actively using it. They’re designed to improve the user experience or guide the user to a specific app action without interrupting their flow.

![In-app notification](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_3A751D176E5DDEDFE7E3CEE16550EBA8C689B2FA68656B180A10AE82ED7A93DE_1725986843967_T2ANydmY83.png)

With a [75% open rate](https://truelist.co/blog/push-notification-statistics/), in-app notifications perform better than push notifications. Some common forms of in-app notifications include onboarding tips in the form of modals, tooltips, banners, etc.

### Email notifications

Email notifications are usually sent to a user’s email address. They are often more formal and provide more detailed information than other notification types.

![Email notification from Novu showing a new message notification](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_3A751D176E5DDEDFE7E3CEE16550EBA8C689B2FA68656B180A10AE82ED7A93DE_1725286615735_Screenshot+2024-09-02+at+15.16.39.png)

Email notifications are especially beneficial for reaching users who may not actively use the app, service, or website but still want to stay informed. Examples of these include newsletters or order confirmations for customers.

### SMS notifications

SMS notifications or SMS messages are text messages sent to a user’s mobile phone. They are mobile messaging typically used for urgent or time-sensitive alerts and provide a direct and reliable way to send messages that reach users regardless of their device or internet connection. Due to SMS’s non-reliance on internet connectivity, they are best suited for almost every user base. Use cases for this include sending verification codes, service alerts, etc.

## Benefits of using a notification platform

Here are ways notification platforms play a vital role for businesses and developers seeking to enhance user engagement and [communication experience](https://novu.co/usecases/improve-communication-experience/?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service):

**Improved user engagement**

Notifications, among other functions, remind customers to interact and engage with a product. Through [multi-channel delivery](https://novu.co/usecases/multi-channel-notifications/), users can receive notifications in a convenient format. This, combined with high relevance and customization, helps the business target, engage, and communicate with each user on a more personal level, leading to higher engagement.
    
**Enhanced customer experience** 

Users turn off notifications or, in extreme cases, [delete applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/zc9mv/dear_app_developers_if_your_app_spams_up_my/) for various reasons, primarily when notifications are sent at inconvenient times or too frequently, leading to notification fatigue and frustration.

However, notification platforms provide valuable analytics on user engagement, such as the optimal time of day to send notifications and the most effective formats for different user segments. Marketing, Product, and Developers can leverage these insights to deliver value and drive engagement by ensuring timely, relevant, and well-paced notifications.
    
**Increased operational efficiency**

Notification [workflows](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/workflows) streamline repetitive communication tasks by automating them end-to-end, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. Through seamless integration with business systems like customer relationship management (CRM) or marketing automation tools, [workflows](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/workflows) ensure that critical notifications are triggered automatically at precisely the right time.

For instance, when a new customer is added to the CRM, a [notification workflow](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/workflows) can automatically initiate a sequence of messages, such as a welcome email followed by onboarding tips, without requiring additional input from the sales or marketing team. This automated workflow not only reduces the workload on customer service teams but also ensures consistency, minimizes human error, and creates a smooth, responsive user experience.

**Subscriber (recipient) management** 

Notification platforms simplify managing large numbers of subscribers by organizing them into specific segments, enabling precise targeting and personalization. Businesses can easily manage [subscriber](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/subscribers) lists, track engagement, and customize notifications to ensure messages are relevant to each user segment, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

**Multi-tenancy support**

[Multi-tenancy](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/tenants) allows businesses to separate and manage notifications across various clients or brands within a single system, ensuring data privacy and control. This feature enables each tenant to maintain [unique subscriber preferences](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/preferences) and communication styles, making it easier to provide tailored messaging and achieve the specific goals of each organization while operating under one unified platform.

**Better conversion rates**

Many notification platforms offer A/B testing features, allowing businesses to experiment with different messaging strategies, formats, and timings. For example, companies can A/B test different subject lines for an email campaign to reveal which version leads to higher open and click-through rates, directly contributing to better retention rates and conversion outcomes.

**No-Code tools to manage notifications**

With a [no-code user interface](https://docs.novu.co/getting-started/non-technical) (no-code editors), teams can adjust notification messaging, verbiage, and cadence without needing engineering support. This empowers marketing, product, and support teams to fine-tune notifications in real-time, ensuring messages are aligned with current campaigns, user feedback, and evolving engagement strategies, all without disrupting development workflows.

**Improved timing with scheduling and delay functionality**

Notification platforms enable businesses to [schedule messages](https://docs.novu.co/workflow/delay) or introduce a [delay](https://docs.novu.co/workflow/delay), ensuring they reach users at the most effective times. For example, a platform can queue up messages to reach a global audience during their respective peak engagement times or delay notifications based on users' time zones and habits. This minimizes disruption and allows users to receive updates when they’re most likely to engage, reducing notification fatigue and increasing relevance.

**Better user experience with digest functionality**

[Digest](https://docs.novu.co/workflow/digest) notifications consolidate multiple updates into a single message, preventing users from feeling overwhelmed by individual alerts. By grouping updates, [notification digests enhance user experience](https://novu.co/usecases/improve-communication-experience/) and maintain a clean inbox while still keeping users informed. This functionality also benefits companies by keeping users more engaged over time, as they are less likely to opt out of receiving notifications.

**Personalized communication through user preferences**

Offering users the ability to set their notification [preferences](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/preferences#preferences)—such as which channels to receive updates on, preferred frequency, and specific types of notifications—gives them control over their experience. Platforms that integrate [user preferences](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/preferences#preferences) into their notifications create a more tailored experience, resulting in increased user satisfaction and trust, reduced churn, and a healthier relationship with customers by reducing unwanted alerts.

So far, we know why notification platforms are important and what to expect from the right service. Based on our needs, let’s consider some of the available notification services and providers that could be integrated into the notification platform.

## Choosing the right notification platform

Selecting the right notification platform is a critical decision that can significantly impact an application's success. A **notification platform** is a centralized, end-to-end system (or infrastructure) that empowers product and development teams to manage, deliver, and optimize **multi-channel** notifications across in-app, email, SMS, push, and chat channels.

To make an informed choice, I recommend you consider several essential factors to verify that they align with your specific needs and goals.

Here’s a closer look at some of these factors:

**Ease of integration**

When choosing a notification platform, one of the first considerations should be how easily it can be integrated into an existing tech stack. A platform like Novu has a straightforward [integration](https://docs.novu.co/integrations/content/react-email?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) process, well-documented [APIs,](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/overview?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) and support [resources](https://docs.novu.co/guides/integrations/segment?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) that can save the development team time and reduce the risk of implementation errors.

Here are some other common things to look out for:

- Clear and comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.novu.co/getting-started/introduction?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service)
- [SDKs](https://docs.novu.co/sdks/framework/typescript/overview?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) and libraries for the preferred programming languages
- Examples and tutorials for [common use cases](https://novu.co/blog/how-to-build-dev-to-in-app-notification-system-in-20-minutes/?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service)
- Availability of technical support or community assistance

For instance, Novu provides all of these, allowing for easy integrations.

**Cost-effectiveness**

Cost is a key consideration, especially for startups and small businesses with limited budgets. It’s important to weigh the price against the platform’s value for the project. Each platform’s pricing differs, so be sure to check that and consider any rate limits that may apply. 

Novu offers [three pricing tiers,](https://novu.co/pricing/?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) ranging from free to enterprise, that cater to a variety of needs, from open-source projects and startups to large-scale enterprise solutions.

**Feature set**

The feature set of a notification platform determines its ability to meet specific goals. It is best to draw a plan of the project goal and use this to determine the feature set to look for. 

Novu, for example, supports a diverse range of features, including [multi-channel support](https://novu.co/usecases/multi-channel-notifications/?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) and [real-time analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmTRnJdvdJE).

**Scalability**

Scalability is vital so the platform can grow alongside the business without compromising efficiency or risking downtimes. In this regard, when determining the scalability of a notification platform, check for the following:

- The platform’s ability to handle large volumes of notifications during peak times
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms to provide consistent performance
- Support for global delivery, especially if the user base is international

A notification platform like Novu supports [scalability](https://docs.novu.co/architecture/introduction#scalability-and-performance?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) using microservices and Kubernetes, which ensures the platform can support growing requests through horizontal scaling (adding more servers or nodes).

**Security and compliance**

Security and compliance are paramount, especially when handling sensitive user data. Checking reviews and case studies can provide insights into the platform’s reliability and security track record. Beyond that, also look out for the following:

- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Access control and audit logs for monitoring usage and permissions
- Regular security updates and vulnerability management

Novu puts [security](https://docs.novu.co/architecture/introduction#security?utm_campaign=ws-notification-service) at the core of its operations, strictly adhering to industry standards for data protection and complying with relevant regulations.

To make the best decision, thorough research is necessary, including subscribing to the notification platform of choice and testing it against the business’s functional and non-functional requirements.

After choosing the right platform, you get to design the system. Here are some best practices to follow when considering notification design.

---

## Best practices for notification design

Designing efficient and user-friendly notifications requires balancing user, business, and legal rules.

**Respecting user preferences**

Respecting user preferences enhances user satisfaction and reduces the risk of notification fatigue, where users become overwhelmed and may choose to turn off notifications altogether. To avoid this, make sure users can customize their notification preferences to select the type of notifications they receive, the delivery channel, and the delivery frequency.

In cases where users cannot choose the delivery frequency, analytics from the notification platform can reveal the number of times users are most likely to read notifications. This information can help you better time your notifications.

**Maintaining compliance with regulations**

Compliance with regulations avoids legal repercussions and builds trust with users, who are increasingly concerned about how their data is used. To enforce this practice, always obtain explicit consent from users before sending notifications.

**Ensuring data security**

Data security protects users and organizations from potential breaches, data theft, and the associated legal and reputational damage. To counter this, implement end-to-end encryption for notifications, ensuring that data is protected in transit and at rest. This is especially important for sensitive information such as account alerts or transactional messages.

Regular security assessments and audits should also be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities in the notification system.

**Providing opt-out options**

Providing opt-out options is a [legal requirement](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) in many jurisdictions and critical to maintaining a positive user experience. For instance, users might choose to receive email notifications but opt out of push notifications or even choose to opt out of all notifications completely. As a result, ensure users can easily opt out of all or a few notifications.
